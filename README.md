### Hello World in NodeJS!
:sparkles: Just another hello world, this time with NodeJS (and some helpful comments!)
****

This small project was created with the help of Glitch's [Node Beginner](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/project/node-beginner) Tutorial!

Clone this repository, install the dependencies and run `npm run start` to view the working version of the projects.

#### Setting up our development environment:

Let's make sure we have Node.js installed. The easiest way is to [Download it](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) by clicking the green button corresponding your current operating system. Then, let's install it.

Next, we just need to make sure it is installed correctly. We can do that by typing `node -v` in the console. If we see `v` and some numbers, we're good to go! :smile:

After that, we need to create a folder for our project. We can do this by typing `mkdir hello-node` and then navigating to our folder with `cd hello-node`.

Let's have a quick recap: we installed Node.js, and also created a folder for our project. Great way to start! :sparkles:

Now, we can use NPM to create our `package.json` file. Basically, what this means is that it will create a file with all sorts of data from our project *(hint: take a peek at my package.json to have an idea)*.

We'll do this by typing `npm init`, and then following the interactive tutorial in the console. Don't worry too much about it: we can always change this file using our favorite code editor later if we need.

Awesome, so we're now good to follow through the exercises with our own development setup! We rock! :rocket:
